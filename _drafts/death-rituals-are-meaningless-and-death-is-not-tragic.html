<p>There is a great problem we live as human creatures on the planet Earth, and that is the problem of the perception of death.</p>
<p>Death itself is not something tragic; it is a normal phase that <strong>everything </strong>will pass through. When you die, your body will become one with the Cosmic Body (the Universe), and your soul will become one with the Cosmic Soul (God). And then from the Cosmic Body and the Cosmic Soul will appear a new body and soul, and life goes on...</p>
<p>In fact, you are already one with the Cosmic Everything. Your body is part of the Cosmic Body, and so is your soul. So death isn't really more than a dissolution and a change of shape.</p>
<p>In some sense, it is analogeous to a raindrop entering the ocean. Does a raindrop cry when it enters the ocean? Maybe. Who knows? But then the raindrop became the ocean and evaporated again just to reappear as another raindrop. In a sense, you are both gone forever, existing forever, and constantly recycling yourself into novel beings.</p>
<p>And it really makes so much sense to say that death rituals are meaningless too. Death is the same whatever ritual you do (or if you do none). The same old process will happen every single time. The only difference is that with the rituals you will mourn the pain of death (which also happens with every other change (ex: birth)). Don't you tell children to think of something else when they hit their hand and feel all the pain? Do so yourself, and save yourself extra pain that comes in for no reason. Accept and chill about death; it's really not such a big deal.</p>
