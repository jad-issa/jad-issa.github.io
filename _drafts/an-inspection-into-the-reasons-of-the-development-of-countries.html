<p>Throughout history, there has been countries that are simply great and countries that are simply not so. And by great I mean dominant economically, politically, and most importantly, scientifically. The following article is an inspection into the factors that bring a country from a normal weak country into a highly developed one.</p>
<p>Note: talk about the willingness of the people, the hitlerian style, the egyptian religious style, inspect roma and greece and finally discuss the phoenician style of trade and stuff. Finally discuss the technological era and the US and the latest era of European comeback with civilisation.</p>
