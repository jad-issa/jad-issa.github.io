<h2>Humanity is on the verge of extinction</h2>
<p>Humanity is a fragile thing. Really. Our existance relies on very specific conditions. Land, water and air have had very stable compositions since the beginning of humanity, and probably the only factors changing them were some great geological changes.</p>
<p>That is no longer true. We humans are now not just living in our environment, but actively modifying it. This modification does not always rely on concious decisions. Examples would be large scale pollution and global warming; I don't think we have chosen to heat the Earth, did we? Our power in modifying something as big as the whole planet does have a lot of benefits, but just like any other form of power, it poses a huge threat.</p>
<p>Comparing humans to microorganisms, Joseph Jenkins, author of The Humanure Handbook note the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>[T]he human race is looking a lot like a disease — comprised</div>
<div>of organisms excessively multiplying, mindlessly consuming, and</div>
<div>generating waste with little regard for the health and well-being of its</div>
<div>host — planet Earth</div>
</blockquote>
<div>And in fact, we are very much so. At some point, Earth will be overwhelmed, and we will no longer be able to live in it.</div>
