<p>Let's face it: humans are stupid. I am stupid, you are stupid, we are all stupid.</p>
<p>When you try your best to be smart, you still do stupid things. When you want to make your life in a certain way and know exactly what you should and should not do to take it into this road, you will still be stupid and do otherwise.</p>
<p>We are inherently stupid. We cannot be but stupid.</p>
<p>The true questions lie here: why are we still trying not to be stupid? Why are we still trying to beat ourselves? Why are we always at war with ourselves trying to be different, trying to change ourselves?</p>
<p>It doesn't make any sense to try to be smart when we know we will still be stupid. It doesn't make sense to expect from ourselves not to do anything wrong, and yet simultaneously know that we are imperfect and will always do wrong. We are being stupidly stupid. We do not know how to manage our stupidity, and that is what makes us such a rotten humanity. I mean, just think about it: you know you are stupid, yet you pretend to be smart.</p>
<p>I think I have a little tip on living life better and more successfully that have been proven at least in my case. Treat yourself the way you know you are. Treat yourself as a stupid person.</p>
<h2>Personal anecdote about memory</h2>
<p>Let me just take a tiny little example of me and my memory. I have a real problem with my memory: if something does not sound very interesting and exciting to me, there is no way I can remember it, however important it may be.</p>
<p>In the old days, I used to try to remember and force myself to keep on remembering, but indeed it didn't work out. I thought I could beat myself and not be so stupid. Well, it turns out I can't. I couldn't remember anything more, and perhaps, I remembered even less.</p>
<p>Recently, I have admitted to myself that I am indeed incapable of remembering things that are not interesting to me, so I decided to do the following: treat myself as a person with Alzheimer's disease. I now never try to make myself remember something uninteresting; I know I would be wasting my time. Whenever I want to remember something, I know write it on a little piece of paper with a lot of details, and stick that paper right where I would need to take action for the thing I should remember. For instance, if I have a question to some teacher, then I write on the notebook, on the page which I know I will open when the class starts. This way there is no way to forget, because I don't even rely on myself remembering at the first place. Sounds like a stupid strategy? Try it, and tell me what you see as a result.</p>
<p>I think most of us know what they should do and what they should not do, and how to go about doing so, but we still fall short in our recognition of our stupidity. So let's actually recognize our stupidity and fix our problems not by forcing ourselves not be stupid, but by hacking our stupid systems, and making them do what we consciously want using their stupidity. So instead of stupidity being an obstacle to achieving conscious goals, we should transform stupidity so it becomes a driving force toward our goals.</p>
<p>I will give a few examples before I end the post.</p>
<h2>Computer programmer example</h2>
<p>A computer programmer might try to code some software, so they go ahead and do everything they can trying to make it as good as possible. When they finally complete the software, they go ahead and test it, and whoop! Nothing works. The software doesn't even start.</p>
<p>There are two options that may be chosen by the programmer:</p>
<ol>
<li>Look back at the code, and consider one smart enough to be able to recognise the flaws by rereading the code</li>
<li>Look at the debugger and see what it reports the problem is</li>
</ol>
<p>As any experienced programmer will tell you, it will never work the first way, because simply no one is good enough to recognize the mistakes they made, and so the wise programmer will go by the second way and look at what the debugger says. By doing so, the coder is recognising his/her stupidity and going around it without ever needing to put it to the test again, as he/she will always fail to be smart enough.</p>
<p>Another example, still in the programming context, is the apparent use of IDEs. An IDE is a program that will do much of the simpler work for you, and will hint you on what could be written in the code before you even complete your code. The use of IDE is also another confession that a programmer is stupid and cannot write the whole thing by themselves. Actually, I think it is quite important that programmers do recognise their stupidity in their work field, since if they didn't, it would be practically impossible to do any useful work.</p>
<h2>Math test example</h2>
<p>Let's now examine what happens during a math test. The test taker thinks they are so good as to be able to go through all the work of processing huge equations, and so they do go through that work (this is part of the test anyways, so they should do so) and somewhere along the lines written, the test taker makes a stupid mistake, such as replacing a - sign with a + sign and the whole exercise will be spoiled since every question is related to the previous questions in a math test.</p>
<p>At the end what they get a really spoiled math test, and that happens even if he/she knows math well, and has possibly studied quite extensively for the test.</p>
<p>The funniest thing of all is actually that if the student recognises they have done something wrong, they will simply just go and reread what they have written heartedly believing they will find the mistake. And as you might have guessed, they rarely ever find it.</p>
<p>The solution here is to find ways like the debugger (see the programmer example) that will allow you to see what wrong you did without you ever needing to be intelligent. Better yet, one should be able to find an analog to the IDE in the math taking context that will guide the test taker through the process of answering the questions. One such thing can be a fool-proof method to follow step-by-step and that can just not support errors.</p>
<h2>Weight loss failure</h2>
<p>Let's talk about weight loss. People seeking to lose weight probably know of the two main ways of doing so:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consuming fewer calories (eating less)</li>
<li>Burning more calories (working out)</li>
</ul>
<p>Even more importantly, they know all the tips they have read online on how to improve willpower and whatever and ultimately lose weight. Yet, they will still fail.</p>
<p>What's the problem here? Well, I don't know what exactly is the problem, you may rather ask psychologists or neurologists maybe. But I can tell you something: just like everyone else, these people are stupid, and because they are stupid, they will rarely lose weight by expecting themselves to be smarter and control themselves in order to succeed.</p>
<p>They should rather treat themselves as stupid people, and for example, have someone bring them the food they should eat in a day and simply not be able to get more (possibly by giving one's money to some trusted person or something.) This way there is simply no way for them to overeat and get fat. Another nice idea would be to get someone to take some part from your car (say the battery) and you will be then forced to walk to work since there will be no other way to get there.</p>
<p>I know these procedures may be a little harsh, but let's be honest, is it working otherwise? If it is working, then you are of the few lucky people where they have been able to lose weight simply by not being so stupid. Now try doing something else, does it still work? If so, then I highly respect you, you are less stupid than most of us. congratulations. How can we be like you?</p>
<p>If you still think you are not stupid, and if you think that all of what I have said is not applicable to you, or maybe to anyone, then go away, and only come back when you have a meaningful response. I would like to hear that.</p>
