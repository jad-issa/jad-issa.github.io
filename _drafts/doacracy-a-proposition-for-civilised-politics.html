<p>In this new era of world politics, after the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_war" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cold War</a> has somewhat ended, and after the success of the American free market and capitalism, the relationship between the people and the state has changed drastically. Today, people recognise the role of a goverment, but also know that it is not a sufficient actor for good and development. Additionally, and most importantly, people recognise the capabilities of individual initiatives.</p>
<p>American free market has allowed people to freely start any initiative they want: launch a business, found an organisation, etc... This brings the power directly to the people. Although American free market has failed to address human issues, it was very good at developing the United States as well as the whole world economically, scientifically, and technologically.</p>
<p>But the rise of the US is not the only time popular initiative has shown itself to the world, rather, it was the time where it most took effect. One thing to note is that that isn't because the US wanted it to be so, rather, because it was going to happen anyways because of the improvement of the conditions of the average person due to development in science in technology.</p>
<p>Today, the US ceases to be the best example of popular initiative driving development. A better place to see this is Europe. Specifically, if we are to observe the politics of Switzerland, we find that a major actor in it is the concept of '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_initiative_(Switzerland)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">popular initiatives</a>' whereby people can suggest laws to the government, but that is only a small portion of what could be the effect of initiatives.</p>
<p>Doacracy is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anarchy</a> done right. And as we all know, anarchy does not work unless the people are civilised. Luckily, we are starting to see today that people are actually getting civilised more than any time before. More and more are people getting to know what is good and what is bad for humanity, and to act accordingly.</p>
<p>Let us first discuss what the term 'civilised' really means. Before each one gets racist to say that people like him/her are the civilised type of people, let us try to find an objective meaning for it. The word civilised refers to civilisation. When talking about civilisation on Earth, in this world, we wouldn't get much further than talking about 'civilised' people, but when talking about alien civilisations, we strangely all agree on what civilisation means and at least kind of have a feel as to what it means for it to be developed.</p>
<p>On the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kardashev scale</a> of civilisations, civilisations are assumed to be a united group of intelligent individuals who are working together toward the same goal, namely, getting higher on the scale. That might be done explicitly or implicitly, but that's what civilisations do.<br />
In the movie 'La Planete Sauvage' (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantastic_Planet" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fantastic Planet</a>,) the Oms are creatures which are working all together toward the same goal: develop spiritually and technologically to improve their lives.<br />
In sci-fi doomsday movies, the aliens almost always seem to be united in conquering us, for some reason that makes their lives somehow better.<br />
In 'The War of The Worlds,' the Martians come to Earth to save their (united 'civilisation.')</p>
<p>So you can clearly see that when it comes to something exterior to us, we almost always agree on the meaning of civilisation, but for some reason, when we start to talk about it in a way that concerns us as humanity, we fail to keep an objective look to civilisation.</p>
<p>The first thing that will make us a true civilisation is thus to understand what civilisation means and to be able to look at it in the broader view of things and truly want to reach it.</p>
<p>Once one understands civilisation and decides to act in a way as to get there, one will quickly find many things that can be done in this regards. All of these things have in common, first and foremost, the <strong>unity of the people of humanity</strong>. That quickly entails all of the 'laws' of human rights as well as universal contribution wherever possible (more on that later.) Secondly, they all involve an <strong>intention of upgrade</strong>; importantly, an equal upgrade affecting everyone's life equally. Thirdly, and most importantly, all actions require a <strong>conscious perception of civilisation status and development</strong>.</p>
<p>Here are a bunch of things that can be done (not all of them concern all people:)</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not buy your grocery or any other items from the big supermarkets/companies and opt as best as possible to buy everything you need from the smaller retail shops. This means that there will not be any of the dominating markets, and makes competition fairer which would mean that you'd allow your neighbours who have small markets to be able to sustain a living.</li>
<li>Contribute to open data sharing between all of us:
<ul>
<li>If you're a developer, write open source code almost always and contribute to open source projects so that they may provide an open and fair technical base for everyone to work with.</li>
<li>If you're a photographer, writer, musician, or otherwise a content producer, then make your content available under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Creative Commons</a> licenses (my preffered one is CC-BY-SA) which will allow people to make use of your work in order to produce work that is better and more beneficial to the 'upgrade' of civilisation.</li>
<li>If you're a researcher, do not accept working at big companies, and only publish your work in open research journals that allow open data access for people forever. This is really important. Consider the example of a computer science researcher. If you are a very good AI researcher, you might be requested to join Google's AI team for instance, or you may be able to join a research group like OpenAI. While at Google you'd probably get a much higher salary than at OpenAI, you are not contributing to the whole of humanity, instead you are only contributing to your money and to Google's money and power, and just that.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Whenever you can, teach others the things that you know. Education is extremely important in a civilised world because this is what allows us to develop ourselves and get better and better; I don't think anyone will go against me on that one. So the point is, if you want to do something, if you want to become a 'doacrat' for a civilised world, you should definitely teach people the things you know about whenever that is possible (and learn from them what they can teach you.)</li>
</ul>
<p>There are plenty of other things that can be done, but this article is not about a list of things you can do to make humanity better, but rather, it is meant to propose a new system of society which is far superior than simple 'democracy' and which is very convenient for a civilised world.</p>
<p>Democracy is in some sense only good for people are not good enough to know themselves and the good they can do, but in a civilised world -- which we are getting closer and closer to -- people understand their roles in the whole of humanity and have enough power to act on humanity and drive it for the better. We can see a clear push toward this end when we observe 'leadership' campains and courses and the like which basically blur the difference between 'leaders' of a country and the people within it.</p>
<p>Our current system of democracy means that the people will choose a bunch of other people which they think are apt to lead and control society, but is this really a 'rule of the people?' I don't think so. This more like a carefully crafted dictatorship. The more power you remove from the government and give back to people the more real democracy becomes. Some systems are trying to do just that. Again, let's consider Switzerland's direct democracy system which removes the right of law making from the parliament and gives it back to the people. But notice, that the Swiss people are, at least comparatively, a civilised people who can support this kind of system. But not all countries are occupied by a civilised people. For example, direct democracy in Lebanon -- the country where I live -- simply does not work, because the Lebanese people cannot afford to manage their own affairs very well; they are farther away from civilisation that the Swiss.</p>
<p>I am open to criticism, so if you think I am partially wrong, or an absolute idiot, please explain how; I really want to hear other oppions. Also, if you think I'm right, don't hesitate telling me and possibly adding to what I have said, but it's definitely not enough to cover a new societal system. To do so, you may write in the comments; alternatively, you may write me an email to <a href="mailto:jadystic@protonmail.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jadystic@protonmail.com</a>. This is not my main email, so don't try spamming me. Also, this means I might not be able to respond instantly.</p>

<p>We have seen previously that doacracy is a nearly ideal system for a proper civilisation in the future which will hopefully be nearer</p>
