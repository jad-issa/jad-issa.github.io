I am a computer science student at the 
[American University of Beirut](https://aub.edu.lb) and a mathematics student
at the [Lebanese University](https://ul.edu.lb).

My focus is on topics at the intersection of mathematics, computer science, and
philosophy, including: type theory, category theory, foundational mathematics
and computer science, proof assistants, formal languages, proof theory, etc...

This blog is an attempt to get the word out there about the fields I love which
seem to be under-rated in popularity. So go ahead, and browse some posts and
enjoy learning about these amazingly interesting theories!
